# CS 416 Final Project - Narrative Visualization
This repository hosts a narrative viz website for the final project in CS416 - Data Visualization at the Univeristy of Illinois Urbana/Champaign.

This narrative visualization displays statistics including popularity in 2017, intelligence levels, and male weight in kilograms for each dog breed, displayed by working group.  It is intended to be used by those who are looking to add a new furry friend to their family, but aren't familiar with the various types of dog breeds that exist.
